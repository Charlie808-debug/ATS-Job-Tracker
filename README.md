An automated Applicant Tracking System (ATS) job tracker built using **n8n** to streamline internship and job searching. The workflow detects the ATS used by a company's careers page, extracts current job openings, matches them against user-defined preferred roles, and updates a Google Sheet automatically.

---

## Overview

Searching hundreds of company career pages manually is repetitive and time-consuming. This project automates that process by integrating Google Sheets, n8n workflows, and ATS-specific APIs.

The system currently supports:

- Workday-based career portals
- Role-based job filtering
- Automatic Google Sheets updates
- Modular workflow design for adding new ATS platforms
